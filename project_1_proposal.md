# Project 1 Proposal

**Data:** https://snap.stanford.edu/data/amazon-meta.html

This dataset does not come ready to be drawn or visualized since the edges are not defined in a list format with tuples. 
The first step is to find out how to load this data into an easily consumable format where it is also easy to be transformed.
I will be dropping all the categories except for videos since it has the least products/nodes.
Then I will create the edges so we can use nxviz to visualize the nodes and edges.

**Hypothesis:** DVD products with the most review also gets recommended the most by the Amazon recommendation feature.
